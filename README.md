# Kotlin Ecosystem LMS course task

This repo contains a server for a Learning Management System.
The server will evolve together with your tasks.
Everything in [temporal anomaly](./src/main/kotlin/org/jetbrains/edu/teamporalanomaly) folder is subject to change, 
everything else is almost guaranteed to stay the same.
Feel free to change the server yourself, but note that then it will be your burden to follow the "main" implementation.

## Task 1
Right now the server is a simple CRUD server for tasks. 
Each task has a description and language, in which it should be solved.

The first task is to write an Android application, which would be able to CRUD (duh...) tasks from the server.
